## Pokémon height game
Little Pokémon-game to play with Svelte and learn a little bit about asyncronous JavaScript (With the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)). CSS was obviously not the focus.
Saw too late that i initialized git outside the folder I was working with, oh well.

[Play it here](https://vetlem.com/pokemon-height-game/)

## To run
```
git clone https://github.com/vetlemangrud/pokemon-height-game.git
cd pokedex
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

## To build
Do the same as above, but change `npm run dev -- --open` to `npm run build`
